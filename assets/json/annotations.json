Ultimately, this helped him make inroads in key areas of battleground states.","cities":""},{"id":"12","abbr":"FL","area":"Florida","swing":"","declared":"yes","header":"Florida","annotation":"Democrats got a small scare when Biden lost by such a substantial margin in Florida. Biden needed to run up the score in Miami, but he actually lost votes there compared to Hillary Clinton’s performance in 2016, partially because he wasn’t able to garner the support of Cuban American voters.","cities":"[\n{ \"id\":\"12086\",  \"abbr\":\"FL\" ,\"capital\": false, \"name\":\"Miami-Dade\", \"coords\":[-80.5682,25.6171],\"render\":true}\n]"},{"id":"55","abbr":"WI","area":"Wisconsin","swing":"swing","declared":"yes","header":"Wisconsin","annotation":"As results came in from the rust belt, Democratic fears of an urban slump were eased. Biden secured a large margin in Milwaukee, but more importantly he gained a huge number of votes in its suburbs compared to 2016. Widespread Black Lives Matter protests broke out here after police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old black man, in August.
