{"sheets":{"annotations":[{"id":"US","abbr":"US","area":"US","swing":"","declared":"no","header":"How is Biden leading?","annotation":"Biden made gains across the country compared to fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost in 2016. But the most crucial gains were in the rust belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, whose 54 electoral votes went to Trump in 2016 but swung toward Biden in 2020."},{"id":"42","abbr":"PA","area":"Pennsylvania","swing":"swing","declared":"yes","header":"Pennsylvania","annotation":"Biden ate into Trump's advantage in white working class counties – the areas that heavily favored Trump in 2016 and helped him win that election by a mere 44,000 votes. Biden also accrued even larger margins in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Many Democrats voted by mail, which meant they were counted later, so the initial tally didn't fully reflect Biden's comfortable lead."},{"id":"26","abbr":"MI","area":"Michigan","swing":"swing","declared":"no","header":"Michigan","annotation":"It wasn't just the massive turnouts in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Flint that handed Biden the win; it was also the modest gains throughout the suburbs compared to Clinton in 2016. That was more than enough to defeat Trump, who won the state by just 10,000 votes in 2016. "},{"id":"39","abbr":"OH","area":"Ohio","swing":"","declared":"yes","header":"Ohio","annotation":"Trump won Ohio handily in 2016, activating white working class voters in rural areas and industrial towns. Many of those voters stayed home this election. That helped Biden gain votes across the state, while running up the score in the Democratic strongholds of Cleveland and Columbus."},{"id":"37","abbr":"NC","area":"North Carolina","swing":"","declared":"yes","header":"North Carolina","annotation":"Significantly more Democrats voted by mail than Republicans, and once those votes were counted, it was clear Biden had a decisive lead. Biden was helped by huge turnouts in the cities – Raleigh, Charlotte, and Greensboro – and a strong turnout from black voters. The only other time the state voted for a Democrat in the past 40 years was in 2008, when Biden was Barack Obama’s running mate."},{"id":"12","abbr":"FL","area":"Florida","swing":"","declared":"yes","header":"Florida","annotation":"Trump won Florida in 2016 by less than 100,000 votes – a margin he was unable to hold onto. Biden found modest gains in the suburbs and the panhandle, most of which stayed reliably Republican. But the difference was the huge turnouts in the Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties, all of which skew toward Democrats."},{"id":"04","abbr":"AZ","area":"Arizona","swing":"","declared":"yes","header":"Arizona ","annotation":"A large Latino turnout helped Biden make gains in the state's largest county, Maricopa County, which Clinton narrowly lost in 2016. Biden also won the second-biggest county, Pima County, much like Clinton, but by a significantly larger margin. This marks the first time a non-incumbent Democrat has won Arizona since Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.
